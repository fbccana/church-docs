# Committee Guidelines & Secretary Responsibilities

## Purpose
This document describes expected procedures for church committees, with emphasis on the role of the committee secretary and how committee records are managed by the Support Office.

## Committee Secretary — Core Responsibilities
- Take clear minutes at every committee meeting using the committee minute template (store templates in shared drive or ask the Minister of Administration for the current template).
- Record attendance, motions (including mover and seconder), voting results, and action items with responsible party and target dates.
- After each meeting, send finalized minutes (PDF preferred) to: the committee chair, the Minister of Administration, and the Support Clerk (email or via shared drive) within 5 business days.
- Maintain an ongoing archive of committee minutes and documents for the committee chair and submit any records retention requests to the Minister of Administration.

## Support Clerk — Receiving & Filing
- Scan and file committee minutes (as received) into the central records archive and update the committee index.
- Notify the committee chair and Minister of Administration when minutes are received and indicate if any follow-up is required (missing signatures, unclear action items).
- Follow the records retention policy for committee materials (see Records & Retention section below).

## Meeting & Scheduling Best Practices
- Confirm meeting time and room with the Support Office at least 7 days in advance.
- Use the standard committee agenda template and circulate it 48 hours before the meeting when possible.
- Keep meetings focused and close with clear action items and owner assignments.

## Records Retention & Confidentiality
- Committee minutes and non-confidential documents: retain for a minimum of 3 years. Finance-related committee documents may follow longer retention per Finance policy.
- Confidential pastoral or personnel matters should be recorded in a separate confidential file and handled according to Personnel/Privacy policy; confidential files are only accessible to authorized personnel.

## Templates & Tools
