# 5. Implementation Recommendations

## 5.1 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Validate Ministerial Accountability Matrix** with your pastoral staff. Ensure each minister agrees to their assigned domains.

2. **Socialize the "FLC Shift"** with the Family Life Center staff. Clarify that their primary RACI role is **Physical Logistics** — they own the building; secretaries own the content.

3. **Create a "Weekly Deadline Checklist"** from the Bulletin and Worship Slides RACI charts. Post this in the office and distribute to all ministers. Include:
   - Content deadlines
   - Who provides what
   - Who approves what
   - Printer cutoff times

4. **Train MPS on Vendor Management Role.** The shift to outside printer means MPS is now a vendor relationship manager, not a machine operator.

5. **Establish Spanish-Language Workflow.** P-HISP should formally own the process for:
   - Spanish bulletin content
   - Spanish worship slides
   - Hispanic membership pathway
   - Hispanic music selection

## 5.2 Long-Term Maintenance

- **Keep RACI Live, Not Static.** These charts should live in your Department Playbook, Wiki, or SOP documentation. Review them annually or upon staff turnover.

- **Onboarding Tool.** Use these RACI charts to onboard new ministers, secretaries, and FLC staff. It answers the question: *"Who do I go to for X?"*

- **Don't Put RACI in Job Descriptions.** Use RACI to *write* job descriptions, then file the charts in your operations manual.
