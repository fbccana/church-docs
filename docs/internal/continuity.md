# Continuity & Handover Procedures ✅

## Purpose
This document centralizes continuity expectations and a short, repeatable drill template to validate backups for critical roles. Use this to schedule, run, record, and improve quarterly handover drills across staff roles.

## Scope
Applies to staff roles that handle time-sensitive or continuity-critical duties (e.g., Church Secretary, Financial Secretary, FLC Receptionists, Media & Communications). The Minister of Administration is the final sign-off authority for these drills.

## Schedule
- **Frequency:** Quarterly (every 3 months) per role.  
- **Duration:** 60–90 minutes recommended.  
- **Participants:** Primary role holder, backup(s), and Minister of Administration (or designee) for sign-off.

## Drill Template (60–90 min)
1. Prepare a short runbook (10–15 min): list of core tasks and any required credentials (where security allows).
2. Execute (40–60 min): backup performs core tasks while primary observes. Tasks vary by role (see Role Examples below).
3. Validate & sign-off (10–15 min): reviewer checks outputs against acceptance criteria and signs off or schedules remediation.

### Acceptance criteria
- Backup completes ≥80% of core tasks unaided.  
- No unresolved critical issues for finance, security, or safety.  
- Runbook updated with any corrections or gaps.

## Role Examples (core tasks)
- **Church Secretary:** reception/phone coverage, membership DB update, generate a report, add a calendar event.  
- **Financial Secretary:** prepare a sample reconciliation, demonstrate dual-authorization deposit workflow, generate stewardship report.  
- **FLC Receptionist:** facility opening/closing checklist, equipment sanitization, visitor check-in, process a reservation.  
- **Media & Communications:** publish a weekly worship guide draft, prepare bilingual worship slides, demonstrate playback/setup.

## Recording the Drill
Use the table below to record each drill. Keep completed entries in this file or in a team-maintained log (Git history provides retention).

| Date | Role | Primary | Backup | Reviewer | Result (Pass/Fail) | Notes / Action Items |
|------|------|---------|--------|----------|--------------------|----------------------|
| 2026-01-29 | Church Secretary | Jane Doe | John Doe | Minister of Administration | Pass | Backup completed 5/6 tasks; runbook updated. |

## Post-Drill Actions
- Update runbook / job file with any clarifications.  
- Schedule remediation training for gaps and re-test within 30 days if critical tasks failed.  
- Record sign-off and move to the next quarter's plan.

## Ownership & Retention
- **Owner:** Minister of Administration (or delegated operations lead).  
- **Retention:** retain drill logs for a minimum of 3 years (or longer if required for governance reasons).

## Tips & Best Practices 💡
- Keep runbooks concise and focused on the “must do” tasks.  
- Use realistic, repeatable scenarios rather than exhaustive checklists.  
- Treat drills as opportunities to update docs, not pass/fail audits only.

If you'd like, I can: (A) add a stub log entry for the recent drills we performed, or (B) insert a short link/reference to this file in each role's `Quarterly Handover Drill` paragraph. Which do you prefer?
