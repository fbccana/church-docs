# RACI: A Practical Guide to Role Clarity

## What is RACI?

RACI is a responsibility assignment matrix that clarifies who does what in processes, projects, or decisions. Each letter represents a distinct role:

- **Responsible**: The person who does the work to complete the task
- **Accountable**: The person ultimately answerable for the task's completion (only one person)
- **Consulted**: People whose input is sought before decisions or actions (two-way communication)
- **Informed**: People who are kept updated on progress or decisions (one-way communication)

## How RACI Works with Job Descriptions

**Job descriptions** define your role's purpose, responsibilities, and qualifications—they tell you *what* you're hired to do.

**RACI charts** show how you interact with others on specific tasks—they tell you *how* you work with your team.

Think of job descriptions as the "what" and RACI as the "who does what with whom." A marketing manager's job description might say "oversee campaign execution," while a RACI chart specifies that they're *Accountable* for the campaign, the content writer is *Responsible* for creating materials, the legal team is *Consulted* on claims, and executives are *Informed* of results.

## What RACI Can Do

- **Eliminate confusion** about who has final decision-making authority
- **Prevent gaps** where everyone assumes someone else is handling a task
- **Reduce overlap** where multiple people duplicate effort
- **Clarify communication flows** so people know when to give input versus just stay informed
- **Speed up decisions** by identifying the single accountable person
- **Improve cross-functional work** by mapping how departments interact on specific deliverables

## What RACI Cannot Do

- **Replace job descriptions** or define your overall role and career path
- **Resolve deeper organizational issues** like unclear strategy or poor leadership
- **Work without buy-in** from the team—it's only effective if people actually follow it
- **Capture nuance** in highly collaborative work where roles are fluid
- **Stay current automatically**—it requires updates when processes or people change

## How RACI Clarifies Roles

RACI transforms vague statements into actionable clarity. Instead of "marketing and sales work together on proposals," RACI specifies: Sales is *Accountable* for winning the deal, Marketing is *Responsible* for creating proposal content, Product is *Consulted* for technical specs, and Finance is *Informed* of pricing.

The key insight: you can be involved in many tasks, but your level of involvement varies. RACI makes this explicit, reducing the frustration of unclear boundaries and preventing the common problem where everyone is "responsible" but no one is truly accountable.
