# EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK

## FBCC of Corsicana

# Part 1: Welcome to FBCC

## About This Employee Handbook

We have prepared this handbook as a general statement of our policies and as a guide for general information that should assist you during your employment. The provisions of this handbook are designed to serve as guidelines rather than absolute rules. Exceptions may be made, from time to time, at the discretion of FBCC.

This employee handbook does not constitute a contract for employment with FBCC either expressed or implied. Employment at FBCC is at-will, unless otherwise provided by a written employment contract that is signed by the Personnel Committee of FBCC.

The statements contained in this handbook do not limit the right of either this church or the employee to terminate the employee’s employment or compensation, with or without cause or notice, at any time, for any reason not contrary to law.

Further, this church reserves the right—at any time—to change, delete, or add to any of the provisions or  benefits, in its sole discretion.

This employee handbook supersedes all prior oral or written handbooks, policies, and guidelines.

If you have any questions about this employee handbook, please contact the Minister of Administration and/or the Personnel Committee.

## Our Mission and Values

FBCC is a non-profit religious church and is substantially controlled and supported by its members.

More importantly, our church is a community of believers who have joined together to meet the spiritual needs of the greater community. Our church promotes behavior consistent with the Holy Scriptures.

Consequently, when joining FBCC staff, you freely and willingly agree to the standards of behavior outlined in this policy. The standards included in this policy are not exhaustive; rather, they provide a guideline of conduct we believe is in accordance with biblical standards.

As representatives of FBCC, it is imperative that our actions are above reproach in all things. Consequently, the following standards of conduct shall apply to all employees. Violations of these standards could result in discipline, up to and including termination:

God’s Word teaches us that certain attributes are desired, including love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22–24). These attributes are to be sought, encouraged, and demonstrated in our relationships.

Scripture further teaches us that certain behaviors should be avoided, including theft, lying, dishonesty, gossip, slander, backbiting, profanity, vulgarity, sexual promiscuity, drunkenness, and immodest dress.

Employees are expected to show Christian concern in their interaction with others, and to join together with a body of believers for worship and fellowship on a regular basis.

FBCC recognizes the danger to one’s physical and mental well-being in the use of certain products. Therefore, employees are to refrain from the use of illegal drugs in any form and abusing alcoholic beverages or prescription drugs.

# Part 2: Employment Basics

## Equal Employment Opportunity & Accommodations

It is the policy of FBCC to grant equal employment opportunity to all qualified persons without regard to race, creed, gender, age, veteran status, disability, or any other legally protected status that applies to FBCC. The recruitment and selection process will be based on job-related, objective qualifications, in accordance with the job requirements of the position being filled. All employees must be able to perform the essential functions of their jobs as set forth in the employee’s individual position description. Reasonable accommodations will be made, in accordance with applicable state and federal law, to assist employees with disabilities in performing the essential functions of their jobs.

FBCC is organized for religious purposes and is substantially controlled and supported by a religious body, (the Baptist General Convention of Texas). Consequently, FBCC enjoys an exemption from the prohibitions contained in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 concerning religious discrimination in employment. Employees who believe they have been unlawfully discriminated against should report it immediately to their supervisor or the Minister of Administration.

### Guidelines

A reporting employee will not be retaliated against for reporting a violation of this policy. In all reported cases, this church will take reasonable steps to protect the reporting employee from retaliatory, harassing, or abusive behavior in relation to such reporting. This church will promptly investigate all reports diligently and will take appropriate disciplinary action against the offender(s), based on the circumstances.

### Accommodations for Individuals with Disabilities

FBCC is committed to complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and all applicable laws providing for nondiscrimination in employment against and reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities, including employees with pregnancy-related conditions. Reasonable accommodation will be provided to individuals with a known physical or mental disability, including pregnancy-related conditions, if such accommodation would not impose an undue hardship on FBCC, and would enable the individual to apply for, or perform, the essential functions of the position in question. Such practices will extend to any terms, privileges, or conditions of employment.

An employee or applicant who requires reasonable accommodation to perform the essential functions of their position should notify the Minister of Administration and submit a request, preferably in writing, for reasonable accommodations. Upon receipt of a reasonable accommodation request, or upon otherwise learning the need of such accommodation by its own observation, FBCC will engage in the interactive process. This interactive dialogue will discuss the need for the accommodation, to the extent permitted by law, the requested accommodation or possible alternative accommodations, and any undue hardship granting such requests may pose to the operations.

FBCC may require an employee to obtain the appropriate medical certification from a licensed health care professional documenting the disability and need for accommodation. All information concerning disabilities will be considered confidential and will be released only in accordance with the requirements of applicable law.

### Religious Accommodations

FBCC will endeavor to accommodate the sincere religious beliefs of its employees to the extent such accommodation does not pose an undue hardship on FBCC’s. If an employee wishes to request such accommodation, they should contact human resources.

### Pregnancy Accommodation (Pregnant Workers Fairness Act)

Employees will be provided with reasonable accommodation for known limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions. Such accommodation will generally be provided unless doing so causes an undue hardship on business operations. Examples of accommodation include flexible hours; additional break periods for bathroom use; more frequent water and meal breaks. Employees may also request a leave of absence following the birth of their child.

Employees or applicants who wish to request accommodation or leave under this policy should contact human resources, preferably in writing. FBCC will initiate the interactive process upon receipt of a reasonable accommodation request or otherwise learning of such a need. FBCC will not discriminate against or retaliate against an employee for requesting such accommodation or for reporting any violations of this policy

### Lactation Accommodation

FBCC will provide a reasonable amount of unpaid break time to accommodate an employee desiring to express breast milk for the employee’s child.  FBCC will provide this break time for up to one (1) year following the birth of a child.  Employees are required to provide reasonable notice to FBCC that they intend to take breaks for expressing breast milk upon returning to work.

## Position Classifications

The following definitions have been established to standardize terminology and provide common understanding in our references to employees:

Employee \- A person who receives wages or salary from FBCC and whose work this church controls and directs.

Full-time Employees \- Employees who are regularly assigned to work at least 40 hours or more each workweek and who maintain continuous regular employment status. Regular full-time employees are eligible for benefits offered by FBCC.

Part-time Employees \- Employees who are regularly assigned to work less than 40 hours each workweek and who maintain continuous regular part-time employee status. NOTE. While part-time employees may occasionally work 40 or more hours in a particular workweek, or in a series of workweeks, that by itself will not change their regular schedule or status as a part-time employee. Part-time employees may be eligible for certain benefits offered by FBCC. Part-time employees are generally classified as non-exempt employees.

Change of Status \- FBCC reserves the right to change the regular schedules of employees at any time. In such a case, FBCC will give affected employees as much advance notice as possible of their new regular schedules and will advise employees of the effect of such changes on their eligibility for company benefits.

Temporary Employees \- Employees whose services are intended to be for a short period of time or of limited duration, or for an indefinite period when there is no intent by FBCC to provide regular status. FBCC may either hire temporary employees directly or may use an agency to supply temporary employees. Temporary employees are not eligible for benefits. If a temporary employee is subsequently hired as a regular full-time or part-time employee, date of hire will be determined by the date on which the employee becomes a regular employee.

Regular Employees \- Employees whose services are intended to be for an indefinite period and who work regularly scheduled hours on an ongoing basis, either full- or part-time.

Exempt Employees \- Employees who are exempt from the minimum wage and/or overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. They typically perform executive, administrative, or professional duties within the church. Exempt employees are not eligible for and do not receive overtime payment.

Non-exempt Employees \- Employees who are not exempt from the overtime and minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Non-exempt employees are eligible for overtime payment as set forth in FBCC overtime policy and as provided by applicable law.

## Personal Relationships & Employment of Relatives

FBCC prohibits “personal relationships” (including sexual, romantic, or cohabitation) at work in the following situations to avoid the potential of a personal relationship adversely affecting others at FBCC and compromising a healthy work environment:

*   Personal relationships between a supervisor and an employee in the supervisor’s chain of command; or

*   Personal relationships between a supervisor and an employee if the employee indirectly reports to the supervisor or the supervisor has effective input into decisions concerning the terms and conditions of the employee’s employment.

Employees involved in a personal relationship with another FBCC employee must promptly report the relationship to the Minister of Administration. Appropriate steps may then be taken to determine whether the relationship violates this policy. A supervisor’s failure to report a personal relationship may result in discipline including, but not limited to, termination.

Likewise, FBCC does not allow relatives to work in an employee-supervisor capacity. This includes, but is not limited to, situations in which one relative:

*   Is supervised by another.

*   Is within a relative’s chain of command.

*   Indirectly reports to the other.

*   Can affect decisions concerning the terms and conditions of the other’s employment.

FBCC also will not consider applications, transfers, promotions, or other similar employment actions if the resulting employment situation would violate this policy. All employees must immediately report the relationship to the Minister of Administration so that appropriate steps may be taken, if needed, including reassignment of personnel. If you suspect the church is unaware of such a relationship, you must report it to the Minister of Administration, so appropriate steps may be taken.

# Part 3: Pay and Performance

## Timekeeping & Payroll

### Pay Periods

On each payday, you will receive a pay stub or electronic pay statement reflecting the pay earned the two weeks before the payroll week. Payday is normally every other Thursday of the month. FBCC directly deposits employees’ paychecks into their designated personal accounts, if elected by the employee.

### Payroll Time Sheets

All employees are responsible for completing timesheets. Timesheets must be submitted biweekly by using TimeClockPlus.  Your time sheet should be completed accurately and submitted to your supervisor for approval.

Exempt employees should record only absences from work, not actual number of hours worked in a pay period. If your position is classified as exempt, you are not eligible for overtime. Sick and vacation time must be taken in a minimum of two-hour increments.

Non-exempt employees must report all time worked. Time sheets must also indicate all vacation, sick, or other time away from the office. If your position is classified as non-exempt, you are eligible for overtime pay. Overtime must be approved in advance by your supervisor.  Employees who work overtime without prior approval will be subject to discipline  for not following FBCC procedures regarding prior approval.

### Payroll Deductions

FBCC is required by law to make regular deductions for taxes imposed by governmental units. These deductions must be made from all paychecks, and the amounts deducted are turned over directly to the applicable governmental units.

Some paycheck deductions based on a court order may need to be made, such as garnishments or child support.

Additionally, this church will make certain deductions from your paychecks upon your request.

By January 31 of each year, this church will provide a W-2 statement showing the total amount of your taxable earnings, as well as all deductions taken from your pay during the previous year.

If you believe that a payroll deduction has been taken that violates applicable law, you should immediately report that belief in writing to the Minister of Administration.

### Guidelines

*   If a payday falls on a holiday, you will receive a paycheck on the preceding workday.

## Overtime

Occasionally an excessive volume of work accumulates, or an emergency arises, that requires a non-exempt employee to work overtime. Overtime is defined as that portion of time that is “actually worked” in excess of 40 hours in one work week. Overtime will be required only when necessary, but employees are expected to work overtime when asked to do so. Non-exempt employees are not to work overtime without prior permission from the Minister of Administration.

Overtime is paid to non-exempt employees for time “actually worked” over 40 hours in one work week. This means that if you take sick or vacation time or have jury duty or funeral leave on one or more days during a work week, overtime would not be paid until you had worked more than 40 hours. Exempt employees are not eligible for overtime.

Under applicable law, nonexempt employees must receive overtime compensation if they work more than a 40-hour workweek. The U.S. Department of Labor defines a workweek as 168 hours or seven consecutive 24-hour periods that can begin on any day and time.  Please contact the Minister of Administration if you need information regarding the FBCC workweek for purposes of calculating overtime.

## Performance Appraisals

Performance appraisals will generally be done annually for all employees. More frequent reviews may be given to newly hired individuals and to those who have been promoted during a given year. Supervisors may conduct special performance reviews of an employee at any time when the employee’s performance, good or bad, warrants special consideration. The performance appraisal has the following objectives:

*   To evaluate how the job has been performed.

*   To discuss performance with the individual concerned.

*   To determine, where necessary, how performance can be improved.

*   To evaluate short-term and long-term goals and potential.

*   To evaluate the accuracy of an individual's job description.

The occasion of a performance review does not automatically signify a pay increase.

### Guideline

Performance appraisal is a continuous process and is not intended as an activity restricted to an annual review. Supervisors and employees are encouraged to carry out informal, regular discussions concerning job performance throughout the year.

# Part 4: Workplace Standards & Conduct

## Personal & Professional Conduct

### Conflicts of Interest & Outside Work

When you accept employment with FBCC, your first responsibility is to this church. Efficiently performing your assigned duties is one part of this obligation. FBCC recognizes that you may desire or need to accept casual, outside employment under certain circumstances. Naturally, any work of this kind would be done outside of your normal working hours. FBCC does not object to you accepting outside employment, as long as it does not:

*   Generally interfere with your regular work hours with FBCC,

*   Affect the efficient performance of your regular duties, or conflict with FBCC’s interests or diminish your ability to render your full, loyal, and undivided service to our church.

Each employee of FBCC also has a fiduciary relationship with the church that is based on loyalty, trust, good faith, and candor in the performance of assigned duties. Each employee should exercise good judgment, high ethical standards, and honesty in all dealings with our church, in order to avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest.

#### Guidelines

Talk to your supervisor and notify the Personnel Committee before pursuing outside employment. All employees are expected to obtain their supervisor’s consent before accepting another job.

You should be aware that work assignments and schedules generally will not be changed to let you perform duties for an outside employer. Further, the church will not consider outside business activities an excuse for not reporting to work or staying for overtime work.

Consult with your supervisor if you have a concern about a potential conflict of interest or if an outside employment opportunity uses the same job skills as your current position. The supervisor will determine if a conflict of interest exists.

Violating this policy may subject you to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

## Attendance & Punctuality

Regular attendance and punctuality are considered essential functions of every employee’s job. Therefore, all employees are expected to arrive on time, ready to work, every day. Our philosophy is that absenteeism is generally controllable. Therefore, absence control is best achieved through individual treatment aimed at the irresponsible, chronic absentee.

We define an absence as failure to report for and remain at work as scheduled. This includes arriving late for work and leaving early without prior supervisory approval. Additionally, absences that exceed the permitted number of hours under the vacation and sick plan may be considered unexcused absences.

If you are unable to arrive at work on time, or must be absent for any portion of the day, you must contact your supervisor as soon as possible. If possible, you should speak directly with your supervisor. If that is not possible, then you must leave a message for your supervisor. Excessive absenteeism or tardiness will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.

Nothing in this policy shall affect the at-will status of all employees, nor shall it restrict, constrain, or prohibit leadership from applying discipline for other actions.

## Drug-Free & Alcohol-Free Workplace

FBCC is committed to protecting the safety, health and well-being of all employees and other individuals in our workplace. We recognize that substance abuse poses a significant threat to our goals. Our health and safety initiatives balance our respect for all individuals by maintaining a workplace environment that is free of illegal drugs, non-prescribed prescription drugs,  alcohol, vaping, and all forms of tobacco. FBCC encourages employees to voluntarily seek help with drug, alcohol, or tobacco problems.

### Covered Workers

Any individual who conducts business for the church, is applying for a position, or is conducting business on the church's property is covered by this substance-free workplace policy (also known as a drug-free & alcohol-free workplace policy). Our policy includes, but is not limited to, all regular and temporary, full-time employees, part-time employees, off-site employees, and interns.

### Applicability

Our substance-free workplace policy is intended to apply whenever anyone is representing or conducting business for FBCC. Therefore, this policy applies during all working hours, as well as whenever a person is on call or paid standby. It also governs behavior while individuals are on the church’s property and at church-sponsored events. Covered workers are prohibited from the following activities:

*   Using, possessing, buying, selling, manufacturing, or dispensing an illegal drug (including possession of drug paraphernalia).

*   Being under the influence of alcohol or an illegal drug (as defined in this policy).

*   Consuming alcohol during the church’s business or while attending church or industry events.

*   Using tobacco or vaping products while on the church’s property or while attending the church or industry events.

### Prohibited Behavior

It is a violation of our substance-free workplace policy to use, possess, sell, trade, and/or offer for sale illegal drugs, or intoxicants. Prescription and over-the-counter drugs are not prohibited when taken in standard dosage and/or according to a physician’s prescription. If you are taking prescribed or over-the-counter medications, you are responsible for consulting the prescribing physician and/or pharmacist to determine whether the medication may interfere with the safe and effective performance of your job. The illegal or unauthorized use of prescription drugs is prohibited. It is a violation of our substance-free workplace policy to intentionally misuse or abuse prescription or over-the-counter medications.

### Notification of Convictions

If you are convicted of a criminal drug violation in the workplace, you must notify the church in writing within five calendar days of the conviction. The church will take appropriate action within 30 days of notification.

### Consequences

One of the goals of our substance-free workplace policy is to encourage you to voluntarily seek help with alcohol, tobacco and/or drug problems. However, the consequences are serious if you violate the policy. If a job applicant violates the substance-free workplace policy, an employment offer can be withdrawn. However, the applicant may reapply after 12 months.

If you violate the policy, you will be subject to disciplinary action deemed appropriate by the church and may be required to enter rehabilitation. If you are required to enter rehabilitation but fail to successfully complete it and/or repeatedly violate the policy, you will be terminated from employment. Nothing in this policy prohibits you from being disciplined or discharged for other violations and/or performance problems.

### Return-to-Work Agreements

Following a violation of the substance-free workplace policy, you may be offered an opportunity to participate in rehabilitation. In such cases, you must sign and abide by the terms set forth in a Return-to-Work Agreement as a condition of continued employment.

### Assistance

FBCC recognizes that alcohol, tobacco, and drug abuse and addiction are treatable illnesses. We also realize that early intervention and support improve the success of rehabilitation. To support our employees, our substance-free workplace policy, FBCC encourages you to seek help if you are concerned that you or your family members may have a drug, tobacco, and/or alcohol problem. Treatment for alcoholism, tobacco, and/or other drug use disorders may be covered by the employee benefit plan. However, the ultimate financial responsibility for recommended treatment belongs to you.

### Confidentiality

All information received by the church through the substance-free workplace policy is confidential communication. Access to this information is limited to those who have a legitimate need to know in compliance with relevant laws and management policies.

### Shared Responsibility

A safe and productive substance-free workplace is achieved through cooperation and shared responsibility. Both employees and management have important roles to play.

You are required to not report to work or be subject to duty while your ability to perform job duties is impaired due to on- or off-duty use of alcohol or other drugs. In addition, employees are encouraged to report dangerous behavior to your supervisor. It is the supervisor’s responsibility to:

*   Report any violations to the supervisor.

*   Clearly state consequences of policy violations.

### Communication

Communicating our substance-free workplace policy to both supervisors and employees is critical to our success. To ensure you are aware of your role in supporting our substance-free workplace:

*   You will receive a written copy of the policy.

*   The policy will be reviewed in orientation sessions with new employees.

*   The policy will be posted at all the church’s locations.

While on the church’s property, all visitors and vendors are encouraged to comply with this policy. Employees should communicate these expectations to their guests prior to the event.

### Definitions

"Church’s Property" includes but is not limited to, all buildings, offices, facilities, grounds, parking lots, lockers, places, and vehicles owned, leased or managed by FBCC or on any site on which the church is conducting business.

“Illegal Drug” means a substance whose use or possession is controlled by federal, state, or local law but that is not being used or possessed under the supervision of a licensed healthcare professional.

“Under the Influence of Alcohol” means either of the following:

*   An alcohol concentration equal to or greater than .04 percent.

*   Actions, appearance, speech, or bodily odors that reasonably cause FBCC to conclude that you are impaired because of alcohol use.

“Under the Influence of Drugs” means a confirmed positive test result for illegal drug use per this policy. In addition, it means the misuse of legal drugs (prescription and possibly over-the-counter) where there is not a valid prescription from a physician for the lawful use of a drug. Any medicine containers in an employee’s possession must include the employee’s name, the name of the substance, the quantity or amount to be taken, and the period of authorization.

“Tobacco,” for the purpose of this policy, means any form of tobacco-based product: cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, and any form of vaping product.

## Harassment-Free Workplace

FBCC will not tolerate any form of harassment, including but not limited to sexual harassment or any offensive conduct that has the effect of substantially interfering with an employee’s work performance or creating a pervasive, intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.

FBCC has instituted the following three-step procedure for reporting and investigating allegations of unlawful harassment, including sexual harassment:

1\. Reporting: An employee who believes that he or she has been the victim of harassment or has witnessed harassment has a duty to report it immediately to his or her supervisor or to the Minister of Administration. In all reported cases, this church will take reasonable steps to protect the reporting individual from retaliatory, harassing, or abusive behavior related to such reporting.

2\. Investigation: The Minister of Administration will direct the investigation of complaints. All employees are expected to cooperate with an investigation of any type of harassment. Confidentiality will be maintained to the extent permitted under such circumstances.

3\. Corrective Action: After the investigation has been completed, the Minister of Administration will make a determination regarding the resolution of the matter. If warranted, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken, up to and including dismissal.

### Guidelines

Generally, may harassment exist whenever the following factors are present:

*   Unwelcome, hostile, or inappropriate conduct directed toward an individual because of his or her protected class, and

*   The conduct creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for the individual in which to work, live, or learn.

Harassing behavior can include, but is not limited to:

*   Verbal or written attacks against an individual.

*   Intimidating or hostile acts that relate to an individual’s race, color, gender, national origin, age,  disability, or any other legally protected status.

*   Jokes or epithets about another person’s race, color, national origin, sex, disability, age, or any other protected class.

*   Physical contact that is non-consensual or unwelcome.

*   Refusal to offer employment, educational opportunities or other benefits of employment to someone because of a protected status.

Sexual harassment may exist whenever these factors are present:

*   Unwelcome sexual advances (either verbal or physical), requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature have occurred, and

*   Submission to such conduct is either an explicit or implicit term or condition of employment, and submission to—or rejection of—the conduct is used as a basis for making employment decisions, or

*   The conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.

Sexual harassment may include, but is not limited to:

*   Unwelcome sexual advances.

*   Verbal abuse or physical conduct of a derogatory or offensive nature.

*   The display or communication of pornographic material.

*   Job-related requests for sexual favors.

Sexual harassment does not refer to occasional compliments or other socially acceptable conduct that doesn’t have a discriminatory effect on the employment relationship.

## Workplace Safety & Security

It’s important that a safe, secure workplace be maintained for the benefit of this church’s employees, members,  students, or others on the premises. Accordingly, any actual or potential threat to safety within the workplace will be promptly addressed. Any employee who threatens or commits violence in the workplace faces disciplinary action, which could include immediate termination. No threats of violence will be tolerated.

“Violence” includes physically harming another, shoving, pushing, harassing, intimidating, coercing, displaying weapons, or threatening or talking of engaging in those activities. It’s the intent of this policy to ensure that everyone associated with this church, including employees, members, students, or others on the premises, can feel as secure as possible in this environment.

This church specifically allows employees to possess firearms on our property, with the stipulation that they gain and provide legal documentation meeting state of Texas requirements for concealed carry. In addition, the employee must inform the Pastor and submit proper documentation for their employee file. Appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination, will be taken against any employee who violates this policy.

Desks, telephones, computers, and work areas are the property of FBCC and employees should have no expectation of privacy with respect to the same. Accordingly, FBCC reserves the right to enter and inspect your work area, classroom, storage areas, computers, or desks, with or without notice.

All business and personal visitors should use the designated entrances of the building and check-in with the receptionist during office hours. This helps our church provide security and maintain proper procedures.

Employees should immediately report any suspicious people or activities to the Pastor and/or business administrator. They should also report any threats of violence against an employee or the church, as well as any violations of this policy.

## Discipline, Grievances, and Investigations

### General Discipline

FBCC requires all employees to follow policies, procedures, and rules established by the church, act in a professional manner at all times, and perform their assigned duties in a timely, effective, and competent manner.

When employees perform at an unsatisfactory level, violate an organizational policy, or engage in misconduct, FBCC will provide employees with reasonable opportunities to correct deficiencies, where possible. However, with employees who are at-will, FBCC may decide to terminate an employee at will, at any time, with or without cause and without following any particular system of discipline or warning.

Examples of some of the types of corrective action that FBCC may take include oral counseling, written counseling, suspension with or without pay, probation, or a combination thereof or termination of employment when disciplining an employee.

Sometimes an incident involving an employee may require an investigation. In that instance, the employee may be placed on an investigatory leave to give FBCC an opportunity to review the circumstances related to a potential disciplinary matter. Doing a complete investigation can help leadership to render an appropriate decision on how to handle the matter fairly.

When an employee is on investigatory leave, the leave is typically paid and will not negatively affect an employee’s personnel file until the results and decisions from the investigation are officially made. The final results of the investigation may lead to documentation and other disciplinary action, if warranted, up to and including termination.

Each situation that may require potential discipline will be handled on an individual basis. It will take into consideration the specific facts of the case, the severity of the conduct in question and any other factors that FBCC deems relevant. Furthermore, whenever a discipline issue is formally documented, employees will typically be asked to acknowledge that the employee was given a copy of the document by signing the original. The employee’s signature will acknowledge receipt of the document but will not signify the employee’s agreement with the contents of the document.

### Open Door Policy

FBCC encourages an open channel of communication for the expression of employee concerns. There may be circumstances where an employee has unsuccessfully attempted to resolve concerns or complaints. Every effort should be made to resolve difficulties and misunderstandings on the basis of Scripture. Consequently, the grievance procedures to be followed are based on Matthew 18:15–17. With the exception of harassment (including but not limited to sexual harassment), discrimination or matters you believe constitute a violation of law, each step must be taken before proceeding to the next level. If you have a concern, follow these procedures:

*   “If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.” The first step is to go directly to the person with whom you have a concern. Attempt to resolve the matter without involving other people.

*   “But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.” The next step is to take the matter to your direct supervisor or human resources.

*   “If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church.” If the matter is still unresolved after you have consulted your supervisor or human resources, you may take your complaint to the Personnel Committee. The Personnel Committee will meet within four weeks of receiving a written request for a hearing. The Personnel Committee is the final arbitrator in resolving complaints that are made under this policy.

#### Guidelines

*   There is one exception to the first step of resolution. An employee who believes that he or she has been the victim of harassment (including but not limited to sexual harassment) or discrimination has a duty to report it immediately to their direct supervisor and/or Personnel Committee.

*   When taking issues to the Personnel Committee, be aware that certain policies apply. For example, in most cases, an employee is not entitled to have an attorney present at the hearing. This process for resolving conflicts is conciliatory in nature and is intended to resolve issues within the body of Christ. (I Corinthians 6:1–8).

### Whistleblower Protections

This policy is intended to help ensure FBCC creates a workplace that operates with the highest integrity and complies with applicable laws. This policy is not intended to protect individuals who make reports that are fraudulent, malicious, or in bad faith. Moreover, this policy shall not interfere with customary employment decisions.

#### Reporting

Employees who believe in good faith that any employees or agents of FBCC are engaged in improper activities may report such activities to their supervisor. If the activities involve a supervisor or if an employee feels uncomfortable reporting such activities to a supervisor, a report should be made to the Personnel Committee Chairperson. This policy applies to any activities that are considered illegal, dishonest, unethical, or otherwise improper.

#### Investigation and Confidentiality

After an employee makes a report under this policy, the Pastor and/or Personnel Committee will conduct a prompt and thorough investigation. Any subjects of the investigation will be excluded from leading the investigation. Promptly following the investigation, and subject to any legal constraints, the following will happen:

*   The person who made the report will be informed of the results.

*   Findings will be issued.

*   Disciplinary action, where appropriate, will be taken.

FBCC shall use reasonable efforts to protect the confidentiality of the party making a report under this policy and the subject(s) of such report, to the extent permitted by law.

Investigations shall be made discreetly, whenever reasonably possible, with information being shared only on a need-to-know basis or as otherwise required by law.

#### Anti-Retaliation

Employees may make reports under this policy without fear of reprisal or retaliation. This church prohibits retaliation and will take reasonable steps to protect the reporting individual from retaliatory, harassing, or abusive behavior related to making a report under this policy.

#### Violations of this Policy

An employee who subjects another employee to reprisal or retaliation in violation of this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Additionally, an individual who makes reports under this policy that are fraudulent, malicious, or made in bad faith shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

### Cooperation with Investigations

Employees are required, and have a duty, to cooperate with any investigations initiated by FBCC. Such inquiries include, but are not limited to, investigations of complaints under the church’s harassment, equal employment opportunity, and whistleblower policies.

However, an employee’s cooperation shall not be required if such cooperation would compromise that employee’s self-incrimination protections under applicable law or would otherwise be unlawful. Such cooperation shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

*   Providing truthful accounts of incidents or activity that you may have engaged in or observed.

*   Consenting to searches of your personal property that is on FBCC property and FBCC’s property under your control.

*   Assisting with obtaining any other information or documentation reasonably requested by FBCC.

With respect to any such investigations, confidentiality will be maintained to the extent possible under the circumstances. An employee violating this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

# Part 5: Communication & Technology

## Electronic Media & Technology Use

FBCC provides a variety of electronic systems and services to improve the effectiveness of communication and information flow. Electronic media means any electronic program, access, or services, including but not limited to, any computer hardware or software, electronic mail, and the Internet.

### Electronic Media Use Policy

FBCC’s electronic media and services have been developed and maintained for the specific use of the church’s correspondence, communication, and research information gathering. For employees’ convenience and expediency, electronic media may be used for incidental, personal communication and purposes. Good judgment should be used to limit the amount and frequency of such use.

These systems, including the equipment and the data stored in the systems, are the property of FBCC. Thus, all electronic data or documents created, sent, received, or stored in the systems are this church’s property.

Employee communications transmitted by the church’s systems are not considered private. FBCC has the right to access, monitor, inventory, review, audit, delete, and disclose, with or without notice, for any reason, including time and content, all information sent, communicated or stored on the church’s systems, whether or not they are communications. Additionally, routine system maintenance or troubleshooting by system administrators may result in electronic messages being accessed. This church reserves the right to remove software, licensed or unlicensed, from any church-owned equipment at any time.

The church is not responsible for any privately owned equipment used for the church’s purposes.

No equipment, hardware, or software, including mobile devices, may be physically attached, installed, or added to church networks or systems without prior approval from the business administrator. Connecting a personal mobile device to a wireless network provided by the church is permitted and does not require such approval. The church reserves the right to remove software, licensed or unlicensed, from any church-owned equipment at any time.

All other FBCC policies, including but not limited to, harassment, confidentiality, social media, and software use policies, apply to the use of electronic media.

### Passwords & ID Codes

Access to electronic media is limited to those employees with proper authorization and may require the use of an ID code or password. Employees must keep all passwords confidential and out of public view. Care should be taken in setting passwords to avoid making them easily discoverable. Passwords should not be shared.

### Software Use

FBCC will provide necessary software for use on church computers in accordance with federal copyright law and applicable licensing agreements.

FBCC does not condone the unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted computer software or documentation.

Employees are not permitted to install, execute, run, or load personal or work-related software on church computers without permission from the business administrator. If you use personal software on a church computer, with the approval of the business administrator, the church has the right to request proof of the software license. It is your responsibility to ensure personal software is used in accordance with its license.

FBCC has the right to access, monitor, inventory, review, audit, delete, and disclose, with or without notice, for any reason, including time and content, all information or software sent, communicated or stored on the church’s systems.

The church reserves the right to remove software, licensed or unlicensed, from any church-owned equipment or computer at any time.

Every employee with access to electronic media is responsible for taking the appropriate security measures to prevent loss, misuse and damage, including damage caused by computer viruses. Any unexplained loss or alteration of data should be reported immediately to the business administrator.

### Unacceptable Uses

Unacceptable uses of electronic media or communications include, but are not limited to, the following:

*   Use for any purpose that violates state or federal laws.

*   Use to transmit or access information that is disruptive to the church’s operation.

*   Use to transmit or access any content that is illicit, unsavory, abusive, pornographic, discriminatory, harassing, or disrespectful.

*   Use to create any social networking persona or blog that may appear to speak for the church, but is not approved by the church.

*   Use to post any information about the church’s operations or decisions on a blog without the business administrator’s prior approval.

*   Use to falsify the sender’s or author’s identity or to misrepresent another person.

*   Use to transmit or access confidential information to individuals who are not authorized to receive such information.

*   Use to transmit non-critical, non-business broadcast mail/data, distribution of chain letters or other mass distributions that cause stress on any computer or network system or disrupt the operation of the church.

Abuse of any electronic media or services or violation of this policy, through excessive personal use, or use in violation of law or other FBCC policy will be subject to immediate review. The violation may result in disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment. It may also lead to legal action.

### Guidelines

Employees should keep in mind that electronic messages can be readily printed, viewed, listened to, or forwarded to other users. Electronic messages also may be mistakenly addressed and sent to the wrong person.

Although there are security measures in place to protect the privacy of internal electronic media and communications, it is impossible to ensure the confidentiality of any electronic message. If you must send sensitive communication or legally protected information to someone outside of this church, it is imperative that a secured and encrypted method of communication is used. Email sent outside the church is NOT currently considered a secure method of communication. In using electronic media, employees need to keep in mind the nature of electronic communications.

You may not use a non-church email service to send or receive church-related information. However, you may use a web-based email account for your personal email and access it from a church computer. You may also access your church email account via the Web from a non-church-owned device.

You may not store church documents, photos, or files with an Internet service under an account that FBCC does not own or manage. However, you may access personal photos or other files you have stored with an Internet service.

## Ownership Of Work Product

All developments relating to FBCC or capable of beneficial use by FBCC, including, but not limited to, object code, source code, marketing, confidential and trade secret information, techniques, slogans, designs, artwork, and writings, compositions, which an employee conceives, makes, develops, or acquires, either solely or jointly with others, during his or her employment, in whole or in part on FBCC time or with FBCC equipment and resources, and shall immediately become and remain the sole and exclusive property of FBCC.

All employees agree to grant and assign to FBCC any and all rights, title, or interest now existing or that may come into existence throughout the world that employees may have in any developments as described in the above paragraph. Employees may not assign, or license rights to, such developments to third parties without the written consent of FBCC.

### Guidelines

Developments include, but are not limited to, inventions, discoveries, improvements, ideas, software, formulas, and processes conceived by an employee.

Employees shall promptly and fully disclose in writing all such developments to FBCC, and shall at any time either during or after the employee’s employment, upon request of the FBCC without charge, execute, acknowledge, and deliver to FBCC all instruments that FBCC may request to enable FBCC to file for, and to acquire, maintain, and enforce, all trademarks, service marks, registrations, copyrights, licenses, patents, and any other intellectual property rights reasonably desired by FBCC covering such developments.

## Media & Public Inquiries

Occasionally, a media representative may contact an employee about an issue at your church. No employee is to give media interviews without prior approval of the Senior Pastor. If contacted, employees should forward any inquiries to the Senior Pastor. This policy will ensure that accurate information will be given for those matters that are appropriate for public knowledge. While on campus, news media representatives should be accompanied by a staff member.

# Part 6: Time Off and Leave

## Vacation & Sick Leave

FBCC will grant vacation and sick leave to full-time employees according to the following schedule:

Table 1\. Vacation Accrual

| Term of Employment | Hours Per Pay Period | Annual Limit | Max Accrual |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0-5 yrs | 3.08 | 80 hours | 120 hours |
| 5-10 yrs | 4.62 | 120 hours | 160 hours |
| 10+ yrs | 6.16 | 160 hours | 200 hours |

Ministerial staff will be allowed one Sunday of leave for every week of vacation plus two additional Sundays for job related activities (Not to exceed six Sundays annually).

Consecutive Sundays cannot be taken off without approval by Senior Pastor for Ministerial Staff or the Personnel Committee for Senior Pastor.

All written or verbal agreements between a Search Committee and potential Ministerial candidates should be reviewed by the Personnel Committee before presentation to the Church.

All records related to an employee hire should be kept on file in the Church Office.

### Sick Leave

Sick leave may be used only for health care appointments, personal illness, or the illness of a close family member. A close family member includes a parent, child, or spouse of the employee or a parent or child of the employee’s spouse. Sick leave will not be paid to employees when they leave employment with this church.

### Vacation Time

Vacation time may be used for vacation, personal business, or additional sick leave once the allotted sick days have been exhausted. Vacation time should primarily be used for scheduled absences and should be approved by the supervisor at least 24 hours in advance. You are expected to receive approval prior to taking any vacation time. Supervisors have discretion when approving vacation time. Seniority is one factor that supervisors may consider, but they are not required to consider seniority in making their decision. Employees are required to exhaust all vacation time before unpaid time off will be granted.

Vacation that has been earned will be paid upon a separation in good standing when the employee gives a two-week notice. Accrued vacation will be paid up to the annual limit as noted in Table 1.

### Guidelines

*   If an employee exhausts all sick leave and is subsequently ill, the employee will generally be required to use available vacation time. Employees are generally not permitted to take unpaid time for illness when vacation time is available.

*   While vacation time can be used for illness once sick leave has been exhausted, an employee generally may not use sick leave for anything except the following: personal illness or the illness of a close family member.

## Bereavement Leave

When a death occurs in an employee’s family (or in the family of an employee’s spouse), this church will provide paid bereavement leave. Pay will not be granted for any day in which the employee is otherwise compensated (such as a paid holiday) or for any day the employee would otherwise not have been at work.

Bereavement leave is provided as follows for a relationship to you or your spouse:

*   Up to 5 Business days: Immediate Family (ie. Spouse, Child, Parent)

*   Up to 2 Business days: Non-Immediate Family (ie. Grandparent, Grandchild, Sibling, Aunt, Uncle, Niece, Nephew)

Employees may use, as necessary, the maximum number of days granted under this policy. If additional time is needed, employees may use, with their supervisor’s discretion, any available sick or vacation days.

Vacation time may be used to attend funeral services of persons not included in this bereavement leave policy.

The employee’s supervisor must approve any variance from, or modification to, this bereavement leave policy.

Employees who wish to take time off under this policy should notify their supervisor as soon as possible.

## Jury Duty & Civic Time Off

Serving on a jury or testifying as a witness when called is a civic duty, and as such is fully recognized and supported by this church. The following policy governs the amount of time off and method of payment while serving on jury duty or testifying as a witness.

### Jury Duty

It is the employee’s responsibility to notify FBCC as soon as a formal notice regarding jury duty is received. This will allow the business administrator to make arrangements for coverage during this time period. While serving, employees will be paid their regular pay. If the employee is on jury duty for more than (5) days, he/she will be paid the difference between jury duty pay and straight time earnings. Employees scheduled to work while serving on jury duty should return to work after being excused from jury duty.

### Court Subpoenas

When an employee is subpoenaed, advance notification of the absence dates should be made through the supervisor. Appearances in court under subpoenas and/or out of civic responsibility (such as an eyewitness) will normally be considered excused time with pay. Time for appearance in court for personal business will be the individual employee’s responsibility. Normally, vacation days will be used for this purpose.

### Voting

Assuming that an employee has not already voted in early voting, the employee is entitled to take paid time off for voting on election days, unless the employee has at least two consecutive hours to vote outside of the voter's working hours.

## Military Leave

This church will grant an unpaid leave of absence to employees in accordance with applicable federal or state laws regarding military leave. One example is the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994\.

Employees who intend to take military leave must notify FBCC as far in advance as possible.  At FBCC’s request, employees also may need to provide written proof of the reason for leave, the period of leave, and their intent to return to a position within the church afterward. Reinstatement upon return from a military leave will be granted in accordance with applicable law, and employees shall not be discriminated against based upon their military service or affiliation.

## Personal Leave Of Absence

FBCC recognizes there may be times when an employee needs to be absent from work, and the time is not covered by vacation, sick/personal, or any other leave provided by FBCC. Under such circumstances, an employee may request a leave of absence without pay.

If you need to be absent for five or more working days and desire a leave of absence, you must submit a written application to your supervisor before the date you desire to begin the leave, stating the reason for the leave.

Factors including, but not limited to, job performance, absenteeism, departmental requirements, and other factors affecting the church’s operations will be taken into consideration before a request is granted or denied. With that said, FBCC is under no obligation to grant a request for a leave of absence and may deny or grant a request for such a leave for any reason or no reason, in its sole discretion.

All leaves of absence must be approved in advance by FBCC. An initial approved leave of absence cannot exceed 30 days. However, a leave of absence may be extended for periods of 30 days or less upon submission of a new application and further approval by this church.

Before an approved leave of absence, you must make specific arrangements to continue the various company benefit programs such as group health, disability, and life plans. This church has no obligation to provide holiday pay, vacation or sick/personal benefits, or bonuses during an approved leave of absence. Performance appraisals may be deferred for a period equal to the length of the leave. Leaves of absence are unpaid leaves.

A leave of absence may be granted for personal, medical, or other purposes. A leave of absence does not guarantee holding the position open, as this church may find it necessary or beneficial to fill the position. If you don’t return to work at the end of an approved leave of absence or extension, you will be considered terminated.

### Guidelines

A leave of absence does not affect your continuity of employment. Your original date of employment remains in effect.

If you are absent for more than five working days without prior approval from FBCC you will be considered as having voluntarily terminated your employment.

You are required to exhaust all vacation days, sick/personal days, and floating holiday time prior to taking a personal leave of absence.

# Part 7: Employee Benefits

## Benefit Program Overview

For the benefit of employees and this church, FBCC provides certain employee benefits outlined in this handbook. All employee benefits are subject to change or elimination at any time at the discretion of the church. Benefits also may be modified in accordance with federal and state law and will be governed by all existing plan documents.

Temporary employees, part-time employees and people not employed by the church, such as independent contractors, are not eligible for any benefits.

Contact the Minister of Administration with any questions regarding benefits.

## Workers' Compensation

FBCC carries workers’ compensation insurance on all employees for work-related injuries or illnesses. We will comply with applicable workers’ compensation laws and regulations and will provide information regarding the employee’s work related injury/illness to the workers’ compensation carrier, who will make benefit payments to injured or ill employees as provided by applicable workers’ compensation laws.

If you become injured or ill at work, whether work-related or not, the following protocol should generally be followed. If an injury or illness appears severe or life threatening, immediately call the 911 emergency number and follow the directions provided. Then, notify your supervisor. Report any other type of injury or illness at work immediately to your supervisor.

All job-related accidents, regardless of their cause or severity, must be reported to your supervisor immediately. Accidents that are not reported promptly may result in the claim being denied. First aid supplies are available at the first aid station.

### Guidelines

Accidents include all work-related injuries or illnesses that occur while working for FBCC.

Employees have an obligation to report any work-related injury or illness immediately and return to work as soon after an injury or illness as their medical conditions permit.

If you need medical treatment while on church-related travel for a work-related injury or illness, proceed to the nearest medical facility. Report it to your supervisor or the Minister of Administration upon your return.

## Work From Home

FBCC may consider providing a unique work alternative for certain employees, commonly known as “telecommuting.” Telecommuting permits you to work at home instead of physically reporting to the office daily. This alternative is not available to all employees but may be arranged at the sole discretion of FBCC when the arrangement is in the best interest of the employee and the church.

### Eligibility

FBCC will consider at least the following items when determining if a telecommuting arrangement is in the best interest of the employee and the FBCC:

*   A determination of whether the employee’s job duties can be performed remotely.

*   Confirmation that the employee has the equipment, space, and other resources necessary for working from home.

*   A satisfactory review of the employee’s performance record.

*   A supervisor’s confirmation that the employee’s work habits would allow for him or her to telecommute successfully.

*   Whether telecommuting will meet the business needs of the FBCC.

If all eligibility requirements are satisfied, FBCC may consider allowing the employee to telecommute.

### Expectations

Employees are expected to maintain their telecommuting space in a safe manner, free from safety hazards, and to promptly notify FBCC of any injuries by filling out a form that includes a description of what the employee was doing before, after, and at the time of the injury. FBCC reserves the right to require an employee's remote work environment to be approved before the employee can work remotely.

Non-exempt employees are also expected to record all hours worked using FBCC’s time-keeping system. An employee may only work hours in excess of those scheduled per day and per workweek if the employee’s supervisor has given prior approval for such work.

Additionally, telecommuting employees are expected to protect any of FBCC’s confidential and proprietary information, just like employees working in the office.

Telecommuting is a privilege, and the arrangement can be refused or terminated by FBCC for any or no reason at any time. If you have questions regarding telecommuting, contact your supervisor.

# Part 8: Separation from Employment

## Resignation & Final Pay

This policy explains the procedures that employees should expect when a separation from employment occurs. It may include the following elements:

*   A review of employment documents, including an examination of employee handbook, job description, or other documents provided to the employee.

*   Notice provisions. FBCC requests that employees provide two weeks’ notice of resignation. Employees must provide at least two weeks’ notice  of resignation to obtain payment of accrued unused vacation time upon separation from employment.

*   An exit interview process.

*   A requirement that materials belonging to FBCC be returned. Examples include keys, computer equipment, credit card, etc.

*   The method of compensating earned but unused vacation, sick, or other paid time upon termination. Current policy is that employees will be compensated for earned but unused vacation, but will not be compensated for earned unused sick time upon separation from employment.

FBCC will deliver a final separation letter to employees at termination. It will include the following types of information:

*   church’s name

*   Employee’s name and title

*   Letter date

*   Notice of separation

*   The last date of employment

*   Last paycheck date

*   A list of benefits to which the employee is entitled, including their expiration dates. Examples include: Health insurance, short- and long-term disability, and the types of paid time off that may be paid out.

## Employment Verifications

Any requests for information on a former or current employee’s work history, performance, or salary by a third party (such as a prospective employer, financial institution, housing institution, etc.) should be directed to the business administrator. Employees are required to sign a written release of information document authorizing the release of such information to a third party.
