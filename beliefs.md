# 1. ABOUT GOD

God is the Creator and Ruler of the universe. He has eternally existed in three personalities: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These three are co-equal and are one God.

# 2. ABOUT JESUS CHRIST

Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He is co-equal with the Father. Jesus lived a sinless human life and offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of all men by dying on a cross. He arose from the dead after three days to demonstrate His power over sin and death. He ascended to Heaven’s glory and will return again to earth to reign as King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.

# 3. ABOUT THE HOLY SPIRIT

The Holy Spirit is equal with the Father and the Son as God. He is present in the world to make men aware of their need for Jesus Christ. He also lives in every Christian from the moment of salvation. He provides the Christian with power for living, understanding of spiritual truth, and guidance in doing what is right. The Christian seeks to live under His control daily.

# 4. ABOUT THE BIBLE

The Bible is God’s Word to all men. It was written by human authors under the supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit. It is the supreme source of truth for Christian beliefs and living. Because it is  inspired by God, it is truth without any mixture of error.

- Psalm 12:6; 119:105,160
- 2 Peter 1:20-21
- Proverbs 30:5
- 2 Timothy 1:13; 3:16

# 5. ABOUT MAN

Man is made in the spiritual image of God, to be like Him in character. He is the supreme object of God’s creation. Although man has tremendous potential for good, he is marred by an attitude of disobedience toward God called "sin." This attitude separates man from God.

- Genesis 1:27 
- Psalm 8:3-6
- Isaiah 53:6a; 59:1-2
- Romans 3:23; 6:23

# 6. ABOUT SALVATION

Salvation is a gift from God to man. Man can never make up for his sin by self-improvement or good works. Only by trusting in Jesus Christ as God’s offer of forgiveness can man be saved from sin’s penalty. Eternal life begins the moment one receives Jesus Christ into his life by faith.

- John 1:12; 14:6
- Romans 5:1; 6:23
- Galatians 3:26
- Ephesians 2:8-9
- Titus 3:5

# 7. ABOUT ETERNAL SECURITY
Because God gives man eternal life through Jesus Christ, the believer is secure in that salvation for eternity. Salvation is maintained by the grace and power of God, not by the self-effort of the Christian. It is the grace and keeping power of God that gives this security.

- John 10:29
- 2 Timothy 1:12
- Hebrews 7:25; 10:10-14
- 1 Peter 1:3-5

# 8. ABOUT ETERNITY

Man was created to exist forever. He will either exist eternally separated from God by sin, or in union with God through forgiveness and salvation. To be eternally separated from God is Hell. To be eternally  in union with Him is eternal life. Heaven and Hell are places of eternal existence.

- John 3:16
- Romans 6:23
- 1 John 2:25; 5:11-13
- Revelation 20:15
